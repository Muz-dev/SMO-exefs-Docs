# Learning C++ that will be used for modding

As you may know, most games in the modern era are coded in C++ and Super Mario Odyssey is no exception. Super mario Odyssey in written completely in C++, so to mod it, we are going to need to be able to write in C++.

Note

This guide assumes that you already know basic C++. If you don't then I recommend you read about these things as it will make this a lot easier: Pointres References, Classes, Structs and calling functions. If not then I highly recommend you read through the site [learncpp.com](https://learncpp.com)

Anyways, let's begin!

# Pointers

The first thing we are going to talk about is Pointers. There isn't much to say about pointers apart from smo exefs uses alot of it so get used to using pointers and references

#Structs and Classes

The next thing is structs and Classes. These are used all over the game to store values specific to certain objects.

Make a program that declares a Structure and create an object for that structure. Now print all of the objects in that structure.

#Putting them together

Now that you can use structures and pointers let's put them together! Start by creating a project with a structure. Now create an object of that structure. Now, reference that structure using <yourstructname\>& referenceobj = <youoriginalobj\>

Now print the contents of the reference object.

#Conclusion

Now that you can do this we can start to code our first exefs mod! We'll start basic but by the end you should be able to code some incredible exefs mods. Let's begin.
